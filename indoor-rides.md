# SETUP 
- Platforms like Zwift provide a sense of progress and distraction
- dry pair of bib shorts at the 90-minute mark is a total game-changer for saddle comfort and preventing skin irritation.

# ENTERTAINMENT
- Hour 1 (The "Warm-In"): Educational content. Your brain is fresh enough to absorb information.
- Hour 2 (The "Work"): A movie or a series. Choose something engaging but not overly complex. 
This is the hour where "time dilation" usually hits.
- Hour 3 (The "Finish"): High-tempo music or a race stream. When physical fatigue sets in, you need a high-BPM beat or the visual stimulation of a pro race to keep your cadence from dropping.

# TIMING
- Ride Early: Do your long rides first thing in the morning. 
- Avoiding the "dopamine loop" of checking your phone or social media makes it easier to commit to difficult tasks before your brain becomes overstimulated

# NUTRITION
- honey (20g is ~60 calories) or gummy bears as cheap sugar sources
- buying special candies or gummy bears


- Aim to eat/drink every 10 to 20 minutes rather than all at once

# AIR 
- - Use a large fan in front, but consider a rear fan to keep your back and bibs dry
- CO2 levels rise over several hours, decrease cognitive function and make the effort feel harder

# DRILLS
- Use standing drills or cadence changes to shift your body position. Indoors, you are "locked in," so these micro-adjustments prevent soreness
- Mental Engagement: Break a long ride into 30-minute blocks with specific focuses (e.g., pedaling efficiency or stroke smoothness) to make the time pass faster
- Every 3 to 5 minutes, stand up for a few seconds. This is critical for relieving pressure on your undercarriage and preventing the "butt pain" that often limits indoor sessions
- Switch between the hoods and drops, and vary your RPM (e.g., from 90 to 65). This engages different muscle groups and mimics the natural variations of outdoor riding
